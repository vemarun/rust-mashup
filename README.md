### Rust Mashup

An experiment with webassembly and using various languages along with rust.

#### Running locally
```
npm install
npx tsc
cargo run
```

#### WebAssembly
WebAssembly can be used along with Javascript in performance-critical applications to provide near-native speed in the browser.
Webassmbly binary file (.wasm file) can be compiled from various languages like c++/rust. This allows us to write code in various languages other than Javascript.
